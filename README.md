# CAT-AI
The aim of this project is to use deep-learning to improve catastrophic modeling in case of a seismic event. For now, the focus is on the fragility function. This project is a collaboration between the design and technology team of UNDRR and the ROAP of UNDRR.

This project is lead and developed by Bilal Bounajma (design & tech , UNDRR). It  is supervised Revati Mani (design & tech , UNDRR) and Alper Aras (ROAP, UNDRR).

It is also the basis of a semester paper in pursue of a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics at ETHZ suppervised by Patrick Cheridito and Nino Antulov-Fantulin. The tex file can be viewed here:
